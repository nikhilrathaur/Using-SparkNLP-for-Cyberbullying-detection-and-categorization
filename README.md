# Using-SparkNLP-for-Cyberbullying-detection-and-categorization
This is my first attempt using SparkNLP for Cyberbullying detetction and categorization from tweets. This is a simple pipeline. You could try importing real tweets and apply this pipeline in realtime.
Also this is made in a ready to run colab notebook making the process of running the most simplest way possible. Although I would highly encourage to write and understand the code and implementation by yourself.
Please fork the repository if you use the code. Would be encouraging.
